  <b> IBM WATSON </b></br>
  Watson is a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA
  project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci.
 
  <b> GET Requests </b></br>
  POST and GET are two HTTP request methods. GET is usually intended to retrieve some data, and is expected to be idempotent (repeating 
  the query does not have any side-effects) and can only send limited amounts of parameter data to the server.
